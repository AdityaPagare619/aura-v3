# DEPRECATED: Use the root requirements.txt instead

# This file is kept for backwards compatibility only.
# The single source of truth is now: ../requirements.txt
#
# Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   (from project root)
#
# OR use the unified installer:
#   bash scripts/install.sh
# =============================================================================

# Redirect to root requirements.txt
-r ../requirements.txt
